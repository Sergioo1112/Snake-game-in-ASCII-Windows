Snake game in Windows using C++ I made it because I was bored.
Made by Sergio Vargas Vicente

If you are using Windows 11, run the game as administrator to avoid font bugs.

--- CONTROLS ---

(I = UP)
(J = LEFT)
(K = DOWN)
(L = RIGHT)
(M = Pause game)

(You can change the controls in the input function in the code)
